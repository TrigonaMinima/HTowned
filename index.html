          <p>A small python script which generates the kml file having the coordinates of the hometowns of my FB friends. This kml file is then fed to the <a href="http://indiemapper.com/">indiemapper</a> to plot all the points on the world map.</p>

  <h3><a name="What is it doing?" class="anchor" href="#What is it doing?"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it doing?</h3>

              <p>
              It is using <em>facepy</em> which uses <strong>facebook graph API</strong> to fetch the results from Facebook. It has to be given an <em>access_token</em> (your access token, not mine) which will authenticate the script to fetch results on your behalf.  
              </br></br>
              After fetching the hometowns of each friend it uses the <strong>google geocoding service</strong> via <em>geopy</em> to convert the hometowns into lattitudes and longitudes.  
              </br></br>
              These lats and longs are then written in a <em>friends_hometown.kml</em> file using the <em>simplekml</em> module. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">kml</a> (keyhole markup language) is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers (It's the wiki definition BTW ;)).
              </br></br>
              Now, that we have our data in the required format we can plot it however we want. I just wanted to plot them on the World map, so I used [Indiemapper][4], which is a good mapping platform if you have the data.

<a name="Inspiration" class="anchor" href="#Inspiration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration</h3>

<p>
  Inspiration for this mini project was obtained when I was reading a few answers on <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Python-scripts-youve-ever-written">this</a> question asked on Quora. This question have 98 answers as of today. There are many bullshit answers but some are interesting. From the 2nd part of <a href="http://qr.ae/aNa1J">this answer</a> where the bus travelers all over India on a day are plotted. This sparked an idea in my mind. </br>
  How I reached the hometowns was due to my mother who was asking about the hailing places of my friends. Please don't ask me why?  Even I don't know why.

<h3>
<a name="TODO" class="anchor" href="#todo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To/Can be done...</h3>

<p>There are a few things which can be done here. These things wont be of much magnitude but might help in beautifying the distribution images.</p>

1. Try the above distribution with <strong>D3</strong>. There are very pretty visualizations which can be done by the D3. Although I have heard D3's learning curve is steep.</br></br>
2. Display lines  between New Delhi and other hometowns visualizing a star kind of thing. </br></br>
3. Since I only have 100 FB friends and all are form India, I couldn't make the distribution over the whole World Map. Will try this later in life when I will be having more diversified friends (or I can try the script with someone who just makes FB friends blindly).</br></br>
